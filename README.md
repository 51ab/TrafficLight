# TrafficLight
It is a traffic light source code in java using swing and awt.
Above code doesn't let the user to select the signal as it is already initiated and the sleep time is already set.
You just need to run it in your respective IDEs without using applet and it will show you the output exactly as you seen in a real traffic light.
There is a lot to modify in graphics but it is working well .
Basically used  graphic to represent the traffic light. This will consist of a rectangular panel on which we will display a coloured circle indicating the state of the traffic light. A green circle will display at the bottom of the panel, yellow in the middle and red at the top depending on the state of the light. Only one colorful circle at a time will be visible.
